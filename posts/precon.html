            This post assumes knowledge of linear types. If you'd like to learn
            them <a href="https://austral-lang.org/linear-types">this</a> is a 
            good introduction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was browsing the 
            <a href="https://austral-lang.org">austral</a>
            discord. 
            When <samp>Verdagon</samp> said:
<pre>
Verdagon: hey! just had a bit of a revelation about linear types
Verdagon: linear types are great for enforcing preconditions and postconditions
</pre>
        <p>
            What I believe he means here is that you can create an 
            API like this.
        </p>
<code lang="austral">
type Array[T: Type]: Linear;

-- just a wrapper type around Array[T]
type SortedArray[T: Type]: Linear;

generic [T: Type]
function sort(arr: Array[T]): SortedArray[T];

generic [T: Type]
function binarySearch(arr: SortedArray[T], ...): Option[T];
</code>
        <p>
        Here there is no way to create a sorted array without calling
        <var>sort()</var> and therefore it is impossible to call 
        <var>binarySearch()</var> with an unsorted array which would be
        a bug. Which has now been prevented at compile time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought this was interesting and wanted to use it to create
            a file API.
            I decided I wanted to have the following ways to open a file.
            <ul>
                <li>Read</li>
                <li>Write</li>
                <li>ReadWrite</li>
                <li>Append</li>
                <li>ReadAppend</li>
            </ul>
            Any combinations with both Write and Append are not useful as 
            write allows appending. 
            The issue is we end up with the following API:
        </p>
<code lang="austral">
-- all of the types wrap this one
type FileInternal: Free;

type FileRead: Linear;
type FileWrite: Linear;
type FileReadWrite: Linear;
type FileAppend: Linear;
type FileReadAppend: Linear;

-- this isn't exposed in the interface but 
-- you should know it exists
typeclass FileWrapper[T: Type] is
    method getInternal(): FileInternal;
    method open(filename: String): T;
    -- arguably, close should be here but it doesn't need to be so???
end;
instance FileWrapper(FileRead);
instance FileWrapper(FileWrite);
instance FileWrapper(FileReadWrite);
instance FileWrapper(FileAppend);
instance FileWrapper(FileReadAppend);

-- no methods
typeclass FileReadable[T: Type(FileWrapper)] is end;
instance FileReadable(FileRead);
instance FileReadable(FileReadWrite);
instance FileReadable(FileReadAppend);
-- no methods
typeclass FileWriteable[T: Type(FileWrapper)] is end;
instance FileWriteable(FileWrite);
instance FileWriteable(FileReadWrite);
-- no methods
typeclass FileAppendable[T: Type(FileWrapper)] is end;
instance FileAppendable(FileWrite);
instance FileAppendable(FileReadWrite);
instance FileAppendable(FileAppend);
instance FileAppendable(FileReadAppend);

generic [T: Type(FileReadable), R: Region]
function read(file: &[T, R], length: Index): String;

generic [T: Type(FileWriteable), R: Region]
function write(file: &[T, R], bytes: String): Unit;

generic [T: Type(FileAppendable), R: Region]
function append(file: &[T, R], bytes: String): Unit;

generic [T: Type(FileWrapper)]
function close(file: T): Unit;
</code>
        <p>
            This is not a fun API to write.
            Using it isn't too bad but it's far from ideal.
            Additionally, this pretty simple file API has many instances
	    that take up lots of code and many methods would have nearly 
	    identical internals.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Now many functions
            that use files have to awkwardly ask for a generic with the
            features that it uses rather than one File type.
        </p>

        <h4>Solution?: Type properties</h4>
        <p>
            This is a novel idea (I think?).
            All syntax after this point is poorly defined.
            Imagine a type like the following:
        </p>
<code lang="austral">
record File: Linear has
    Readable: Yes or No;
    EditMode: Write or Append or None;
is
    -- some internal stuff
end;

function open(filename: String, r: File#Readable, w: File#EditMode): File(r, w);

generic [F: File(Readable is Yes), R: Region]
function read(file: &[F, R], length: Index): String;

generic [F: File(EditMode is Write), R: Region]
function write(file: &[F, R], bytes: String): Unit;

generic [F: File(EditMode is Write or Append), R: Region]
function append(file: &[F, R], bytes: String): Unit;

function close(file: File): Unit;
</code>
        <p>
            The idea here is that type properties can be solved 
            at compile time. Additionally, I believe that this can
            be done with a decidable type system. This can? be 
            implemented in other languages at compile time as well,
            like in C++ but it abuses the type systems capablities.
        </p>
        <p>
            This even handles branching to an extent:
        </p>
<code lang="austral">
-- API:
record Example: Linear has
    Prop1: A or B;
    Prop2: A or B;
is
    -- irrelevant
end;

function create(): Example(A, A);
-- the syntax for writeable borrow is poorly/undefined as of now
generic [R: Region]
function setProp1ToB(e: &![Example(Prop1 to B), R]): Unit;

-- doesn't depend on Prop1 so it can be used when Prop2
-- is ambiguous
function consume(e: Example(Prop2 is A)): Unit;



-- Use/Example:
let e: Example := create();
if randomBool() then
    setProp1ToB(&!e)
end if;
-- here on out Prop1 could be A or B
consume(e);
-- compiles
</code>
        <p>
            Basically, if a property is ambiguous (may have changed).
            the variable can still be used if the functions used afterward
            don't require that property to be defined or any values that it
            may hold are allowed. For example, if a type allows <var>A or B or C or D</var> 
            and we know the function accepts <var>A or B or C</var> and it is 
            ambiguous between <var>B or C</var> that would be valid. In this case, that a 
	    property is ambiguous when its information is needed, the compiler would throw
	    an error.
        </p>
	<p>
            I think that this type-state programming is quite a useful idea for preventing bugs
	    at compile time. In fact linear types are arguably syntatic sugar over this type of 
	    restriction, where at the end of a linear type's scope a function call that expects
	    its linearity property to be Consumed at the end of scope, and where all functions
	    that take it as input take it as input but with the restriction that it is 
	    Unconsumed.
	</p>
	<p>
	    This could prevent whole classes of bugs, similar to how linear types can prevent
	    <var>write after close</var> or <var>double close</var>. While linear types can in
	    theory do all of the things these type properties do (without the ambiguoity handling),
	    however this creates many typeclasses and types that aren't needed. For instance, the 
	    SortedArray example from the beginning would require SortedArray to have all the methods 
	    that Array does.
